Overview Of The Project

1. User Interaction
•	User Registration/Login (if applicable):
o	Users create an account or log in to access their personalized to-do list.
o	Authentication ensures only authorized users can access their tasks.
•	Adding Tasks:
o	Users enter task details (e.g., title, description, due date, priority).
o	The task is added to the database and displayed in the user interface.
•	Viewing Tasks:
o	The application retrieves and displays tasks in a list or categorized format.
o	Users can filter or sort tasks (e.g., by due date, priority, or completion status).
•	Updating Tasks:
o	Users can edit tasks (e.g., change the title, mark as completed, or adjust due dates).
o	Updated data is sent to the backend and reflected in the UI.
•	Deleting Tasks:
o	Users can delete tasks. A confirmation prompt may be shown before the task is removed

2. Frontend Workflow
•	The frontend provides a user interface for managing tasks.
•	When users interact with the app (e.g., adding, updating, or deleting tasks), actions trigger events.
•	These events communicate with the backend using API calls (e.g., via REST or GraphQL).
•	The UI is updated dynamically based on user actions or data received from the backend.

3. Backend Workflow
•	The backend handles all business logic, processes user requests, and interacts with the database.
o	Add Task: Validates user input and stores the task in the database.
o	Fetch Tasks: Retrieves tasks from the database for display in the frontend.
o	Update Task: Updates task details (e.g., status, title, or due date) in the database.
o	Delete Task: Removes the task from the database.
4. Database Workflow
•	The database stores and manages task-related data.
 This includes:
o	Task title, description, and status (e.g., completed or pending).
o	Metadata like creation dates, deadlines, or priorities.
o	User-related information to ensure tasks are tied to the correct user.
•	Queries are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:
o	Create: Add a new task.
o	Read: Retrieve tasks for the user.
o	Update: Modify an existing task.
o	Delete: Remove a task from the list.

5. Optional Features Workflow
•	Search and Filters:
o	Users can search for specific tasks by keywords or apply filters (e.g., show only completed tasks).
o	The backend processes these requests and returns filtered data.
•	Notifications/Reminders:
o	The system sends notifications or reminders based on deadlines or user preferences.
•	Offline Mode:
o	Tasks are stored locally (e.g., using IndexedDB or localStorage) and synced to the database when the user is online.
•	Collaboration:
o	Users can share tasks with others or assign tasks to team members.
o	The system handles permissions and updates in real-time.
